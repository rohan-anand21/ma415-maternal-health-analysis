## **Maternal Smoking During Pregnancy: America's Ongoing Crisis** 
### An in-depth look at the impact of maternal lifestyle choices on APGAR scores and birth weights in the United States

<hr>
#### **Motivations for the exploration:**
<div style="text-align: left; width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">

As noted by Yang et al. (2014), maternal smoking is a significant health concern in the United States. Smoking during pregnancy has ramifications at both the individual level and at the societal level. From an individualistic perspective, smoking is known to be one of the most serious risk factors for poor pregnancy outcomes—having consequences for both the mother and the child. On a large-scale societal level, maternal smoking has been determined to increase economic costs. In 1994, the CDC reported that smoking during pregnancy led to more than $366 M in neonatal expenditures; this cost equates to approximately 704 dollars per maternal smoker. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is a highly preventable risk factor, despite its widespread prevalence. 

Thus, Group 14 was interested in taking a closer look into the current landscape of maternal smoking in the United States through the lens of health outcomes for the infant—specifically exploring birth weight and APGAR scores as metrics. Beyond smoking as a risk factor, we also explored a wealth of other variables that relate to infant health outcomes—such as the BMI of the mother.

<hr>
#### **Summary of key findings:**<br>
1) The race with the highest proportion of mothers who smoke before <br>
2) There has been a consistent and considerable decline in the proportion of mothers who smoke during pregnancy for all race groups examined from 2014 to 2021. <br>
3) Additional key finding...<br>
4) Another key finding...

<hr>
#### **Research Question 1**: What race has the highest proportion of mothers who smoke before pregnancy and during pregnancy (by trimester)?

There are racial disparities in ...

You don't have to link to every StackOverflow post you used but if there are explainers on aspects of the data or specific models that you found helpful, try to link to those. Also, try to link to other sources that might support (or refute) your analysis. These can just be regular hyperlinks. You don't need a formal citation.

## Rubric: On this page

You will


* Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
  * Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?
  * What questions are you interested in answering?
  * Provide context for the rest of the page. This will include figures/tables that illustrate aspects of the data of your question.
* Modeling and Inference 
  * The page will include some kind of formal statistical model. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another modeling framework.
  * Explain the techniques you used for validating your results.
  * Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.
* Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
  * Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions?
* Clarity Figures
  * Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
  * Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this. (While not a hard limit, around 5 total figures is probably a good target.)
  * Default `lm` output and plots are typically not acceptable.
* Clarity of Explanations
  * How well do you explain each figure/result?
  * Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
* Organization and cleanliness.
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
  * This page should be self-contained.
