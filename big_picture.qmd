#### **America's Ongoing Maternal Health Crisis: A Look Into Risk Factors Plaguing American Mothers and Their Babies In 2021**

<div style="text-align: left; width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;"> 

Maternal health in the United States is a multifaceted issue, influenced by a wealth of factors ranging from one's race, age, and socioeconomic class. On an individual level, pre-existing health conditions such as obesity and pre-pregnancy smoking are equally important to consider when examining the state of maternal health in America. Racial and ethnic disparities, in particular, underscore the need for a comprehensive approach to address the unique challenges faced by different communities. Age-related factors contribute to varying healthcare needs, with teenage pregnancies and pregnancies in older women presenting its own distinct set of challenges. From the socioeconomic perspective, individuals with limited access to quality healthcare services may encounter barriers to receiving timely and appropriate prenatal care. These varying disparities can manifest in heightened pregnancy risks, adversely impacting both maternal well-being and infant health outcomes. 


While delving into the systemic issues surrounding maternal health is crucial, a wide array of [literature](https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/racial-disparities-in-maternal-and-infant-health-current-status-and-efforts-to-address-them/#:~:text=Black%20and%20AIAN%20women%20have,disparities%20increase%20by%20maternal%20age.) has already provided a comprehensive review on this topic. Our **particular focus**, however, is on elucidating the prevalence of various health risk factors among American mothers today. Specifically, we aimed to explore pre-pregnancy smoking across different racial groups, the spectrum of BMI scores among mothers, the escalating rates of obesity, and how these factors may contribute to the increasing incidence of pre-term births. 

Risk factors for preterm birth are diverse, ranging from maternal age, with women over 40 having the highest rates, to smoking, multiple births, and short intervals between pregnancies. Understanding the relationships and addressing the complex interplay of these risk factors is crucial for improving maternal health, and ultimately to address discrepancies between infant health outcomes. The goal is to promote better prenatal health practices through avenues like healthcare policy reform, targeted interventions for high-risk populations, and general public health campaigns.

#### **Finding #1: The AIAN race has the highest proportion of mothers who smoke**


A well-known risk factor that can lead to adverse outcomes like preterm birth is smoking during pregnancy. We analyzed the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy across different racial groups and determined that American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) mothers have the highest proportion of smoking mothers at 10.89%—more than double that of the next highest group. See Table 1. Since smoking leads to a variety of serious health outcomes, this suggests that the AIAN racial group may be at a higher risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and other developmental issues. The racial groups that presented the lowest proportion of mothers who smoked during pregnancy are the 'Asian' and 'Hispanic' races. What is interesting to note is that our findings, which report for the year 2021, are consistent with those that looked at maternal smoking prevalence in different racial groups during [2010 - 2017](https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2748-y)

#### **Finding #2: Only around 40% of American mothers had BMI scores in the 'normal' range in 2021**


Now that we've established the prevalence of smoking as a risk factor in mothers of different races, our focus shifted to another crucial risk factor: Maternal Body Mass Index (BMI). In 2019, the prevalence of obesity among women of childbearing age had been on the rise, with nearly 3 in 10 women in the U.S. having obesity before becoming pregnant according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db392.htm). This increase is seen across all ages, races, and educational levels. Obesity is a particularly important risk factor to explore because it is linked with adverse outcomes in maternal health including gestational diabetes, cesarean delivery, and preterm delivery. These conditions can directly impact infant health, contributing to preterm birth and other associated risks.

Figure 1 presents the distribution of American mothers' BMI scores across different BMI categories in 2021. The highest proportion of mothers, approximately 38%, fell within the “normal” BMI category, which is considered healthy and carries a lower risk for chronic diseases related to obesity. However, it is concerning to find out that around 30% of mothers fell within the "overweight BMI" category, and that approximately 20% of mothers fell within the "obesity I" category. Both of these latter categories indicate mothers with higher pre-disposed risks during pregnancy.

#### **Finding #3: Prevalence of obesity in mothers has been steadily increasing across most racial groups**

The concerning proportion of mothers who were classified as "obese" or "overweight" in 2021 prompted us to look into obesity rates across the past decade. We were curious to determine if they have been on the rise or on the decline. We plotted the proportion of mothers classified as obese in every race group starting from 2014 to 2021. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results='asis', results='hide'}

      mracehisp == 6 ~ "More than one race",
      mracehisp == 7 ~ "Hispanic"
    ),
    Overweight = bmi_r >= 4) |>

    color = "Race"
  ) +

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1, size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12, color = "#333333"),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(color = "black", size = 0.5),
        axis.ticks.y = element_line(color = "black", size = 0.5),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(),

        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12, color = "#333333"),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10, color = "#333333"),
        legend.position = "right")

```

Figure 2 depicts the differences in obesity prevalence amongst different racial groups over the past decade. When classifying a mother as obese, we chose only to classify mothers as obese if their BMI score is larger than 30. For the following races, obesity among mothers has been steadily increasing: AIAN, Black, Hispanic, More than one race, and White. It's interesting to note that since 2018, the NHOPI race shows the highest proportion of overweight individuals, with above 50% of mothers classified as obese which is a staggering amount. This suggests that they could face more health risks during their pregnancy.

#### **Finding #4: The proportion of pre-term births in the US has been steadily on the rise since 2014**

After analyzing the significant health risk factors for mothers, we wanted to determine if there are obvious influences of these risk factors on mothers and their infant's health. Therefore, we choose to look at the proportion of pre-term births over the years and if there are any trends to note. Preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the United States and globally. It can further impact the child’s growth with long-term health complications, including developmental delays and chronic respiratory problems. According to the research conducted by the March of Dimes Perinatal Data Center with the data supplied by government agencies, the preterm birth rate was 10.5% of live births in 2021, with considerable variation across states and demographic groups in the U.S. Black infants have the highest rates of preterm birth at 14.4%, nearly double that of Asian/Pacific Islanders at 9.0%.

Figure 3 shows the proportion of births classified as pre-term births by mother's race in 2014 and 2021. For every single race, there has been a steady increase in the proportion of preterm births. Figure 3 further depicts that the AIAN race and the Black race had the highest overall increase in the proportion of pre-term births. This discrepancy among pre-term births demonstrates a need for an in-depth examination to uncover the underlying factors contributing to this notable surge among these specific racial groups. Conducting further research is imperative to pinpoint the reasons behind this trend, and further help to implement targeted preventative programs aimed at mitigating the heightened risk of pre-term births in these populations.


Overall, this exploratory study has provided a snapshot of the current state of health risk factors among American moms. Notably, we've found that: <br> 

* The AIAN race has the highest proportion of mothers who smoke
* Only around 40% of American mothers had BMI scores in the 'normal' range in 2021
* Prevalence of obesity in mothers has been steadily increasing across most racial groups
* The proportion of pre-term births in the US has been steadily on the rise since 2014


Further study needs to examine what underlying societal conditions are fueling racial disparities in specific risk factors and to understand the reasons behind the escalating prevalence of certain health risks. This deeper investigation can serve as a foundation for refining and implementing more effective practices or programs, ultimately paving the way for improved health outcomes for both mothers and their infants.

Our further exploration looked more closely at the impact of smoking on the birth weight of infants and the APGAR score 5 minutes after birth (which is a measure of the baby's health). To read further about this study, click on the 'Analysis' page!
