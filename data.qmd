### Data Discovery and Collection

The [data](https://www.nber.org/research/data/vital-statistics-natality-birth-data) we discovered is Natality Data from the National Vital Statistics System of the National Center for Health Statistics. The data set itself was found on the page titled Vital Statistics Natality Birth Data on the website of the National Bureau of Economic Research. In essence, the data was collected in order to give both demographic and health data for births occurring in the United States annually. The data is based on a 100-percent sample of birth certificates from some states and on a 50-percent sample from the remaining states. 

The overarching goal of The National Center for Health Statistics is to collect data that can provide information to be used to improve the public health of American citizens, in this case, mothers, by guiding public policy. It is important to note that the NCHS is a unit of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We are specifically focusing on births only in the year 2021, but will later create a historical record comprised of data from previous years. The individual values in the data is taken from birth certificates that were filed with the vital statistics offices of each state and the District of Columbia.

### Exploring Variables

We first used the only the csv available for the year 2021. Although for further data analysis, we plan to incorporate data from other years such as before the 2000s. It would be intriguing to analyze how birth rates or certain conditions surrounding births compare in two different years. For 2021, the csv file had approximately 3,669,928 entries and over 200 columns containing various attributes related to the birth of a child in the United States. 

We will not be using all the variables for our analysis. Some important variables that we will specifically be looking at are the APGAR score of the child (health score given to the child within 5-10 minutes of being born), the race of the mother and father, the mother’s characteristics (BMI, weight, height), maternal morbidity, various health factors that could have affected the health of the baby when it was born (smoking in the 3rd trimesters, substance abuse), health insurance of  mothers, demographic data about the mother and the father of the infant. 

There are many other variables that are included in the over 200 columns in the dataset that we will not be including (and thus will be removed in the data cleaning process). These variables could include variables that have been “recoded”, but we will use the original version of the variable. Moreover, we will be removing variables such as the “Imputed Flags” or “Reporting Flags” for variables. An important file that guided us as we explored the different variables in our data set was the following file, which is the User Guide to the 2021 Natality Public Use File. This is a comprehensive [file](https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/DVS/natality/UserGuide2021.pdf) that includes descriptions of every variable included in the data set, what it means, and how it was scored/computed/collected. This helped in the evaluation of which variables to keep and which ones could be appropriately discarded.

### Cleaning the Data

In our [load_and_clean_data.R](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R) file, we did not use any R packages outside of those covered in class. 

To clean our data set, we followed these steps:

1. We first read the .csv file of our dataset, which we only want to show the maximum number of rows is 100,000. Then we save it as an .rds file, which includes 1,000,000 entries and 170 columns.

2. For the .rds file, we first remove the unnecessary columns. And we use the all_of function to treat the columns_to_remove vector as a list of column names to be removed. It ensures that each element in the columns_to_remove vector is interpreted as a separate column name. 

3. We create a summary tibble that shows the number of missing values (NAs) per column in the natality_data_cleaned data frame. We apply the sum(is.na(.)) function to every column in the data frame to count the number of missing values (NAs) in each column. The result is a data frame with a single row that contains the count of NAs for each column. We use pivot_longer to transform the summarized data frame from a wide format to a long format. It takes the column names from natality_data_cleanedand the corresponding NA counts and puts them in two new columns: "Column" and "NAs".

4. Then, we transform and recode the columns related to birth month and birth time, and make them more suitable for analysis and presentation. We will continue to recode the columns. 

5. We create a cleaned .csv file from the natality_data_cleaned data frame and save it within the "dataset-ignore" directory.

6. We also save the data frame as an .RData file, which is a convenient way to save and load R objects, allowing us to preserve the data for future analysis and sharing.
